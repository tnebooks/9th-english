title : The Comet'

Rampaging through the heavens
Never stopping day or night,
A spectacle of a lifetime
A comet in full flight.


Faster than a cheetah
With a tail thatâ€™s miles long,
Bigger than a mountain
So powerful and strong.


The outer ice is melting
Causing vapor from the force,
And leaves a trail behind it
As it travels on its course.


If one should come too close to earth
The atmosphere will shake,
With shockwave reaching to the ground
Causing the land to quake.


Scientists say the chemicals
In the dust they leave behind,
Could have started life on the earth
Which resulted in mankind.


I cannot say if this is true
I do not have the right,
But I know no better spectacle
Than a comet in full flight.
