The stick-together families are happier by far 
Than the brothers and the sisters who take separate highways are.
 The gladdest people living are the wholesome folks who make 
A circle at the fireside that no power but death can break.
 And the finest of conventions ever held beneath the sun
 Are the little family gatherings when the busy day is done.

 There are rich folk, there are poor folk, who imagine they are wise,
 And they're very quick to shatter all the little family ties. 
Each goes searching after pleasure in his own selected way,
 Each with strangers likes to wander, and with strangers likes to play. 
But it's bitterness they harvest, and it's empty joy they find, 
For the children that are wisest are the stick-together kind. 

There are some who seem to fancy that for gladness they must roam, 
That for smiles that are the brightest they must wander far from home. 
That the strange friend is the true friend, and they travel far astray
 They waste their lives in striving for a joy that's far away,
 But the gladdest sort of people, when the busy day is done,
 Are the brothers and the sisters who together share their fun.

 It's the stick-together family that wins the joys of earth, 
That hears the sweetest music and that finds the finest mirth;
 It's the old home roof that shelters all the charm that life can give;
 There you find the gladdest play-ground, there the happiest spot to live.
 And, O weary, wandering brother, if contentment you would win,
 Come you back unto the fireside and be comrade with your kin.
